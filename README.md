# hello-world

Hi All!

I am here to learn and explore Python as much as I can.
Then I may use it to create algorithms solve problems in the projects that I am going to create.

Hi again,

I am just touching base again after a restful hiatus. 
Now I am really going to get serious with this coding. 
It is fun.
